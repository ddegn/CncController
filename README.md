# CncController
Code to control a CNC router.
This code is not ready for public comsumption nor viewing.
This repository is a mess. The program will eventual run from different SD files but for now the main program is "EXECUTE_.spin" or "EXECUTEX.spin."
EXECUTEX will read a file from a SD card and move two stepper motors based on the data on the card. So far the code only supports linear moves.
